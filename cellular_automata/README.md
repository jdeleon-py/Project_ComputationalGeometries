# Cellular Automata

### Description

### Notes
* Grid1.py
	* Up to this point, I have developed a pygame window which is able to click on a cell, thus changing the state of the cell (alive: 1, dead: 0)
	* This script is extremely basic. The next step would be to eliminate all hard-coding associated with the window itself, so that I can have any size cell for any size pygame 
window.
