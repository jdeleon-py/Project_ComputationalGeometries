# Epicycloids

These experiments demonstrate a natural phenomenon by a surprisingly algorithmic methodology.

## Description
This section describes what epicycloids are and what the significance of this geometric phenomena has in both the natural world and the computational world.

### Epicycloids in Theory
Note: See the methodology section to catch up with my jargon.

An epicycloid is geometrically defined as a plane curve generated by tracing the path of a chosen point on the circumference of the circle - which rolls without slipping around a fixed-radius reference circle. For instance, consider a point on an interest circle, the circle having half the radius (multiplier = 2) of its corresponding reference circle. If such a point created a plane wave by rolling (without slipping) continuously around the reference circle, the resulting shape would appear to be a cardioid. 

### Epicycloids in Nature
Epicycloids, particularly those with a multiplier of 2 (cardioids), have been noticed in natural occurences as light ray reflections about the inside of a cylindical structure. If a light source is shined at an angle down into the interior of a cylindrical surface, then the reflections of the light overlap as it curves through the cylinder thus producing an overwhelmingly cardioid-esque shape.

### Epicycloids in Fractalline Structures
Focusing primarily on the cardioid (this phenomena can be extended to other variations of epicycloid), the cardioid can appear in various fractal structures. Take the Mandelbrot Set, for instance, the most defined and largest figure present in this fractal is the central cardioid. These fields intertwine from similarities with trigonometric intervention and the multiplier of 2 (specific to cardioids). If a multiplier of 3 is applied, then a nephroid will be the central epicycloid figure in the corresponding fractalline set.   

## Methodology
If the reference circle was discretized into a number of equally spaced points around its circumference, then the trigonometric significance of an epicycloid could be disregarded, with multiplication tables to take its place. Iterating through all points starting from 0, a multiplier would be applied to the current index, thus graphically drawing a line from the current index to the corresponding product. The key of being able to potentially loop around the circle with computational ease is with the modulo function, as seen below-

```python
def solve_product(self, index: int) -> int:
	return (self.multiplier * index) % self.point_num
```

Python's turtle library is used to graphically display the discretized representation of the
